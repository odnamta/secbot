## 1. [LOW] Information Disclosure via X-Powered-By Header

**Asset:** https://atmando-finance.vercel.app/login
**Weakness:** CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information
**OWASP Category:** A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
**Confidence:** high

### Description

The application exposes its technology stack (Next.js) through the X-Powered-By HTTP response header. While not directly exploitable, this information aids attackers in reconnaissance by revealing the exact framework in use, allowing them to target known vulnerabilities specific to Next.js versions.

### Steps to Reproduce

Send any HTTP request to https://atmando-finance.vercel.app/login
Inspect response headers
Observe 'X-Powered-By: Next.js' header in the response

### Impact

Reduces attacker effort during reconnaissance phase. Attackers can quickly identify the framework and search for version-specific exploits, zero-days, or common misconfigurations. This is a defense-in-depth issue rather than a direct vulnerability.

### Supporting Evidence

**Affected URLs:**
- https://atmando-finance.vercel.app/login

**HTTP Request/Response:**

```
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'X-Powered-By',
            value: '', // Remove the header
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
  // Alternative: Use poweredByHeader option (Next.js 12.1+)
  poweredByHeader: false,
};
```

### Suggested Remediation

Remove the X-Powered-By header by configuring Next.js to suppress it. Add a custom header configuration in next.config.js to explicitly remove this header from all responses.
